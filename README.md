Sharing code like sharing pizza.

A web application that allows users to create shareable code editors files in the browser. These are shared peer to peer via their unique URL, the data is never hosted or seen by the server. 

## How it works
- The creator of the URL is the owner of the file
- Everyone with the URL can update the file in real-time
- Owner of the file is the coordinator
