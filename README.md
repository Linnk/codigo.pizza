# codigo.pizza

Sharing code like sharing pizza.

Create shareable code editors in the browser for real time collaboration. These are peer-to-peer connections, your data is never hosted or seen by my server. 

## How it works

- Click "Start new editor" to create a unique session URL
- Share the URL with collaborators to invite them to edit
- All changes sync in real-time using WebRTC peer-to-peer connection
- Built with Yjs CRDTs for conflict-free collaborative editing
